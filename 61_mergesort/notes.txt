DISCO
*length of an array is name.length not name.length()
*set() is for ArrayList/needs to be imported, instead use name[i]
*Don't use the shorter list as a benchmark as to when to stop it wouldn't work in a scenario where the elements of the shorter array is a lot larger


QCC:
* can mergesort be done iteratively?

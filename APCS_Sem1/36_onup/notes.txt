HW 36: All Quacked Up
2021-11-18
time spent: 0.5 hours 

- Compile-time errors: syntax errors. Can be solved by bisection 
	- What if I just do not know what syntax to use... java API..? 
        - Mostly typos and stuff
	- Trying to refer to a non-static variable in a non static method(!!) 

- Run-time errors: happens when program runs; i.e. infinite recursion -> StackOverFlowError
	- Exceptions: - NullPointerException => inst var or object you invoke is null. Declaring 
                                              new variables like arrays, its elements are 
                                              initially null. 
		      - ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException => Array index is 0 to array.length - 1
	              - StackOverflowError => infinite recursion 
                      - FileNotFoundException => file not found 
                      - ArithmeticExeption => math gone wrong i.e. division by 0 

- Logic errors: expected value from program was not outputted 
	- Check flow of execution (put a println in each method) 
	- Try assigning parts of expressions to temporary variables 

- Rage, cope, seethe, mald 
- Consult ducky
- If that dont work, use more ducky or just close computer and call it a day

Our experience:
- Figuring out how to successfully compile the DataStudentCode files was frustrating
  because we were all using git bash and didn't realize that we needed to use different commands
  than the ones provided. We probably could have solved this issue by reading documentation.
- Reading piazza is always helpful to keep track of new posts of questions that different groups
  come up with that we were facing as well.
- It was very interesting to see/imagine how many different ways sinbad/data sets
  could be used in practical ways.



  DISCO:
  - different commands have to be run when using sinbad in git bash.
    However, we were able to solve this issue by sshing into lab computers.
  - Have to be careful with brackets when dealing with nested classes/inner classes
  - Look through entire lab to identify most efficient workflow and plan.

  QCC
  - Why the difference in commands when using git bash to use sinbad vs lab computers
  - What was able to be run on lab computers could not be run on git bash.
  - ??? --> core.ops.SignatureUnificationException: could not find a class named: Observation (ds:no-class)

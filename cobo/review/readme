time spent: 2.0 hrs

DISCO:
*textToString() allows us to read the text from a file
*generally, read closely with the questions and directions since they seem to be asking very similar things

QCC:
* How can we work through this lab faster?

Notes:
* a lot of reading and understanding what the lab is asking of us
* some questions sounded similar so we had to take some time to digest the questions.

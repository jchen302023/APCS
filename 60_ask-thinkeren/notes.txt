HW60: A termite is a turtle, a thinker is a turtle

time spent:

Thinker: Can give, receive, or take.
A thinker with a stack of cards would split it in half and give it to two other thinkers.
Those two thinkers in turn, would do the same. The process repeats itself until each thinker holds only one card each.
The thinkers with one card would then return the cards to the thinker they originally got it from. Because the thinker
is holding one card and arrays with one item are always sorted, the thinker that receives the two cards would have them sorted.
And so on until it reaches back to the very first thinker, who would receive a sorted deck.

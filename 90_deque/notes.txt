HW90: Swabbing the Deque

time spent: 0.5  hr

DISCO:
  Benefits of creating a prioritized todo list:
  - grow code incrementally. tackle the simplest tasks before 
  more complex ones
  - visualize workflow
  - encapsulation diagrams help decide workflow/remove confusion once coding starts.

QCC:
  - worth it to consider an arraylist deque? (no) (eh...) (probably not unless we do a little optimization)
  - why the peekFirst() and peekLast() symbol not found errors at first? (we used peekfirst and peeklast in the remove methods and it created that error)

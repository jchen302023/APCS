HW67 -- A Knight Goes on Tour
2022-02-28
time spent:

Givens/ Asssumptions
- The knight starts in one of the four corners of the board
- It is an empty n by n board
- The knight can not cross a previously crossed place on the board or a place out of the board
- The knight can only move in an L shape (+-2, +- 1) or (+-1, +-2) so it would have 8 possible places
to move to
Goal
- The knight has travelled across the board without crossing a place it had previously
been at, so all spaces on the board have been filled

Finished Product
- Print out the board with numbers representing the knight's move as it has travelled on it

Algo:

- Starting from the corner, you move the knight clockwise in a spiraling motion to fill the outer spaces of the board.
The outer ring of spaces takes priority to be completed. If the outer ring the knight plans to move appears to have no available spots, it
would move to the next inner ring and fill that one until an opportunity to enter the outer ring appears again. Once the outer rings are completely filled,
it would go to the inner rings and repeat the process until the ring is filled.

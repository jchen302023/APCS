DISCO:
- always helpful to refer back to List interface for guidelines on general outline of code
- My brain's 1.5 braincells melted into 1.5 braincells

QCC:
- why the infinite loop when running v6driver? something wrong with our remove method?
- why so many iterators and why can't you typecast MyIterator
- the purpose of returning iterator over list?
